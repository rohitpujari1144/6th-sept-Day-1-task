Difference between Statically typed and dynamically typed language :
	
	Statically typed language :
	
		1. Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile-time
		2. Statically typed languages require to declare the data types of variables
		3. In this every details about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do compiling process.
		4. Ex. C, C++, C#
		
	Dynamically typed language :
		1. Dynamically typed languages perform type checking at run-time
		2. In dynamically  typed language no need to declare the data types of variables
		3. In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code.
		4. Ex. Python, Javascript, Ruby

Difference between Scripting and Programming Languages :

	Scripting languages :

		1. A scripting language is a language that uses a navive method to bring codes to a runtime environment
		2. They are used to creat dynamic web applications
		3. All the scripting languages are intrepeted language
		4. They are used to creat dynamic web applications
		5. Ex. Javascript, Python

	Programming languages :

		1. A programming language is a language which is used by humans to navigate their communication with computers
		2. Programming languages are used to write computer programs
		3. Most of the programming languages are compiled languages
		4. Programming languages are used write computer programs
		5. Ex. C, C++
